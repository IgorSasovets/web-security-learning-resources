## Tips and tricks

**Disclaimer**: This guide covers the first version of this certification. Starting from July 11, 2023 exam is changing. Use [this link](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-security-spec/AWS-Certified-Security-Specialty_Exam-Guide_C02.pdf) to learn more about the key changes. Nonetheless, many of the resources in this guide will remain relevant for the updated version of this certification. I used several courses to prepare for this certification. All of them are listed below.

- Develop practical skills. You can do it by using your own AWS account or by purchasing a training course with labs/AWS Sandbox included
- Make notes during the course to quickly refresh your knowledge when needed
- Do an additional research if you want to better understand a specific topic. Use AWS security whitepapers, blog articles on security topics
- Start from the foundational level certification like AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (AWS recommends to obtain the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification as well before the Security Speciality certification). It will help you to learn basics that will be later used to cover more advanced topics
- Prepare/search for cheat sheets with key characteristics of different AWS Security services
- Review security best practices for the services in scope
- Take practice exams or at least sample questions provided by AWS
